# RNS Care Gap - Mock Website

This is a static, conceptual website to help the team quickly understand the project scope, the v1 gap definition, and the evidence corpus plan.

## What this is
- A lightweight, shareable mock site (no backend)
- No PHI
- Advisory-only / QI framing

## Run locally
From this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:
- http://localhost:8000

## Use on Replit
Option A (simplest):
- Create a new Replit using the "HTML, CSS, JS" template
- Copy the contents of this folder into the repl
- Run and use the preview URL

Option B:
- Keep as a static site and serve via any static host
